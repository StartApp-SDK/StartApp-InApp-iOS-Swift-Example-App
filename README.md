StartApp InApp iOS Swift Example App
====================================

*Updated to InApp SDK version 3.10.0*

This iOS application project provides an example of the StartApp InApp Swift SDK integration.

The example application contains the following ads:
* Interstitial ad which is pre-loaded in viewDidAppear for later use.  
This ad is displayed when clicking the 'Show Ad' button.  
Note that loading an ad takes a while, so it is possible that no ad will be displayed when clicking the 'Show Ad' button.
* Interstitial ad which is loaded and displayed when clicking the 'Load & Show' button.
Note that loading an ad takes a while, so there is a delay between clicking the button and the actual appearance of the ad.  
This ad is loaded upon clicking the 'Load & Show' button, and displayed when the ad was successfully loaded, from within the didLoadAd method of the STADelegateProtocol.
* Splash ad which is displayed right after the splash image
* Return ad when returning to the application after a certain period of time of it being in the background.
* Banner with an automatic positioning at the bottom of the screen.
* Banner with a fixed position and size.
* Native ad example.

When integrating the SDK with your application, please make sure to use the latest SDK version, which can be downloaded from our [developers portal](https://developers.startapp.com).  
Please also follow the integration manual which comes with the SDK.  
Don't forget to use your developer id and application id when initializing the SDK.
